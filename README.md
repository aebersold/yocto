# yocto CMS

yocto is a minimal flat file CMS written in PHP. All content is stored in a single text file using JSON. There is nothing more to it. It comes with a password protected admin interface. There is no page tree, no users, no file uploads.

yocto was created for very small sites where a fully featured CMS would be overkill but where the content has to be editable to some degree. yocto is user friendly enough to allow non-technical people change content without breaking anything.

I needed something wich means "really small". Yocto is the smallest offical SI prefix, hence the name.

## How to use yocto

Check out index.php, it should be self-explanatory.

To get started with yocto, include `yocto.php` in all pages you need dynamic content. To insert a content block in your pages, use `<?= t('fieldname') ?>`. That's it.

```php
<?php
    require_once('yocto.php');
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
    <body>
        <h1><?= y('title') ?></h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Change content

If you want to change your content, just point your browser to `/admin.php`, make your changes, enter the password and save. If you need a new field, add it to the JSON manually. This is intentional, only the developer should be able to add new fields during development.

The file `content.json` needs to be writable to save changes.
